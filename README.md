# ziCPUE:  Zero Inflated Catch Per Unit Effort

This repository is structured with instructive `*.html` files in the parent directory, 
while files used to create these instructions are in sub-folders:

- `R_files`: Raw code in R files (`*.R`); intended for testing and implementing code.
- `Rmd_files`: Full documentation written in R Markdown files (`*.Rmd`). The `*.Rmd` 
  files contain little code and were written to organize code and notes.

For instructions on external referencing in R Markdown and `knitr` (i.e., how I 
used chunks of code from separate R files in R markdown files), see 
[this guide](
