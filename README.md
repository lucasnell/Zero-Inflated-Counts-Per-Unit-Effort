# ziCPUE:  Zero Inflated Catch Per Unit Effort


These files are structured with raw code in R files (`*.R`), and with full documentation
in R Markdown files (`*.Rmd`). The `*.Rmd` files contain little code and are intended to 
be used as instructions only.
The `*.R` files are intended for testing and implementing code.

For instructions on external referencing in R Markdown and `knitr`, see
